Welcome to the web site of the Economics Education laboratory.
Here is some general information about our group
and what we do.

### Overview 

Born of the Active Learning Initiative (ALI) in 2017, the economic education research group at Cornell focuses on developing standard assessments of undergraduate learning and analyzing the copious data generated by the ALI to learn how students learn economics and how we can best teach the subject. We also work closely with education researchers in other disciplines to study big issues like gender gaps in performance, the determinants of long-term retention of knowledge, and peer-to-peer learning.
